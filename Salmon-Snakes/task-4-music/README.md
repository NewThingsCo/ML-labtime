# Task 4 - Fishy sounds

## Objective
Using the input from previous tasks (or from somewhere else) make music

## Available tools

### Tensorflow music
Tensorflow music generator setup in task 1 takes MIDI files as an input and outputs ~20 seconds of new chords.

### Magenta
Take a peek at task 4 in the Dragon track for a browser JS based machine learning tool, please dont judge code too harshly ;)

### MuseGAN
A much more complex setup that we have no examples for!
